# Few-Shot Road Sign Dataset
A carefully selected machine learning dataset designed for few-shot learning scenarios.
This dataset provides a labeled set of images representing various traffic symbols commonly
found on German roads. The images were captured using conventional mobile phones, ensuring
a realistic and diverse representation. Each image is custom-created, ensuring that none of
them exist elsewhere on the Internet.
